I'm a full-time blockchain developer with 1.5 years of experience in this field. I'm proud to have worked with some of the best game developers in the world at my current blockchain combat gaming company. During my 5 years of programming experience, I have also worked as a freelancer for about 3 years, working on a variety of projects across different domains.
  
I'm particularly skilled in backend development, with most of my experience being in the MERN stack. I've worked on several projects using this technology stack, ranging from web applications to blockchain projects. In fact, I've won a few blockchain hackathons, including the ethforall hackathon organized by EthIndia.

Overall, I'm passionate about software development and am always looking for new challenges to push myself further.
